o For THREADED_PTHREADS, improve speed of finding threadid
o Why does C++ test break when use prototypes for pr_summary*?
o Update to C standard allowing stack vars dimensioned by input args.
o "make clean" should always get rid of everything that might have been built
o Revamp test suite. Suggestions:
  - More, shorter tests
  - "make test" should only build what is going to be run
  - Overload specific tests only when necessary
  - Rewrite runalltests* in Perl
o GPU port
o Merge nested OMP to trunk, possibly enabling at compile-time if cost is
  high
